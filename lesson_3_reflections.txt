When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	- when you need to push you local work on github. 
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	- Because it is necessary to decide when to pull or not
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	- forks are used to copy someone's repository to your git account, we use them when we don't have the permission to modify directly someone's repository
	- clones are used to copy a repository from a git account to a machine's local repository, we use them to work on a specific git repository directly from a local machine and push changes.
	- branches are create locally, we use them when working through a local repository
